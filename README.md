# Data Science Projects 🧠📊

Welcome! This repository is a collection of diverse data science and machine learning projects I've completed as part of my transition from theoretical physics to applied, data-driven problem solving. Projects range from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and deep learning, spanning both scientific and real-world datasets.

> 👨‍🔬 Background: I'm a theoretical physicist with 10+ years of academic experience in high-performance computing, simulations, and mentoring, now applying those skills in the field of machine learning and data science.  
> 🌍 Based in Austria | Open to roles across the DACH region | Fluent in English, conversational German (A1–B2).
